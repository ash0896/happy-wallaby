    title: Introduction
    content: "# G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins which are&#xA;involved in signal transduction across cellular membranes and represent about&#xA;3% of the human encoding genome. They display important role in cellular&#xA;communication and are the largest family of membrane receptors. About 30-40% of marketed drugs target a GPCR. Moreover, most potential GPCR drug targets for several indications do not have a drug on the market \\[1, 2]. GPCR activation occurs by the binding of a ligand in the extracellular side, stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor, which leads to the cellular response&#xA;through dimerization with the intracellular G protein (according to generally&#xA;accepted GPCR activation). The ligand for a GPCR compete with the natural&#xA;agonist at the orthosteric side and either mimic (agonist) or block (antagonist)&#xA;the pharmacological effect. Structurally, GPCRs display characteristic and&#xA;conserved features of 7 transmembrane helical bundle, which are connected by 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. Different sequence analysis showed&#xA;that the largest differences of GPCR occurred in the ligand binding site (the&#xA;extracellular part) \\[1]. \n\n# \_\n\n# Ligand based drug design techniques such as quantitative structure&#xA;activity relationship (QSAR) and computational ligand based virtual screening,&#xA;were used for assessing the chemistry of GPCRs due to the lack of structural&#xA;information within the GPCR superfamily. In the last decades, due to advances&#xA;in protein engineering and protein crystallography in association with X-ray&#xA;crystallography structures of diverse GPCRs were revealed motivating the Nobel&#xA;prize in 2012. The mechanism and structures have of diverse GPCRs structures&#xA;were determined using the same approach and the structure for A2AAR&#xA;GPCR was crystallized, this enabled to apply the structure-based drug design on&#xA;GPCRs. Due to high homology between the receptor subtypes which have different&#xA;pathophysiological functions it leads to pharmacological problems (decrease in&#xA;selectivity). To avoid this highly elaborated chemical scaffolds are generated&#xA;which lead to chemical problem (complex heterocycles with poor&#xA;pharmacokinetics). Therefore, despite the large-scale pharmacological interest&#xA;in GPCRs only A2AAR agonist regadenoson and A2AAR&#xA;antagonist istradefylline have been marketed\\[2].\n\n# \_\n\n# The superfamily of GPCRs is divided in classes (A-F)&#xA;as proposed by Atwood and Findlay\\[1]. Out of which the rhodopsin like (class A)&#xA;are the best characterized receptors. Within these, adenosine receptors (ARs)&#xA;are of particular interest as they play an important role in signal&#xA;transduction for the extracellular nucleotide adenosine. The ARs family is&#xA;further divided into four subtypes namely A1, A2A, A2B&#xA;and A3 which mediate the signaling of adenosine\\[2].\_ The A3AR is involved in&#xA;inflammation, pain, and allergic asthma by inhibiting adenylate cyclase, which&#xA;causes the release of inflammatory and allergic mediators from mast cells.&#xA;Therefore, antagonists of A3AR are of use in treatment of stroke,&#xA;glaucoma, inflammation and in development of antiallergic, antihistaminic and&#xA;cerebroprotective drugs. Potentially A3AR antagonists also have&#xA;applications in cancer chemotherapy due to high level of expression in several&#xA;cell lines \\[4]. The A3 signaling is target of ischemia, inflammation&#xA;and cancer,\\[6] but the expression levels and roles on different cellular&#xA;tissues are still unknown. Therefore there is a need of new pharmacological&#xA;tools to investigate on the pathophysiological roles if this receptor. In&#xA;particular, in vivo imaging or detection of receptor dimer or higher order&#xA;oligomers.\n\n# The host lab has been involved in the discovery and&#xA;elucidation of the molecular mechanism of Adenosine receptor antagonists for&#xA;the past decade. The work lately made use of the host lab automated workflow&#xA;for small molecule and protein mutations free energy calculations in Q (QligFEP&#xA;and QresFEP), in particular for the structural mapping of Adenosine receptor&#xA;mutations, binding mechanism of A2AAR receptor antagonist, structure&#xA;based design at the four GPCR subtypes. Among these, the studies on A3AR&#xA;revealed a new pyrimidine pharmacophore with several potent and selective A3AR&#xA;antagonists\\[7].\n\n# The development of structurally simple, potent, and&#xA;selective AR antagonists has been accomplished with integrated approach&#xA;combining succinct and efficient synthetic methodologies and rational&#xA;computer-based drug design. Recently, structurally simple amidopyrimidine&#xA;monocyclic scaffolds with variations at three points of diversity with low&#xA;molecular weight, potent and selective were studied as A3AR&#xA;antagonists\\[5]. The study based on exploring diverse heterocyclic libraries showed&#xA;that tri and bi cyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds, with the pyrimidine core.&#xA;Based on previous studies, it was expected that structural redecoration of aryl&#xA;fragments on the amidopyrimidine scaffolds would modify the selectivity&#xA;profile. The screening of libraries was done by incorporating identical aryl&#xA;groups at positions 4,6 and 2,6 as a proof of concept\\[6]. Highly potent and&#xA;selective A3AR antagonists have been documented by the introduction&#xA;of methoxyphenyl fragments into the 4-aminopyrimidne scaffold. The&#xA;pharmacophore design focus on the nitrogen atom that is considered to be&#xA;involved in hydrogen bond interactions. The N1 and N3 in heterocycle are&#xA;essential for binding with N250 together with the exocyclic nitrogen. The&#xA;second nitrogen atom of the 4-amidopyrimide series increased the binding&#xA;affinities in comparison with the 2-amidopyrimidine series. To understand the&#xA;role of the second nitrogen in the 4-amidopyrimidine series, studies were&#xA;performed by comparing the N1 with the pyridine series. This generated highly&#xA;potent and selective A3AR antagonists\\[5]. However, bioisosteric&#xA;replacement in most cases resulted in a loss of potency.\n\n# Therefore, there is a need of validate this binding&#xA;mode through site-directed mutagenesis and assess the design of new&#xA;pharmacological tools in collaboration with the experimental groups in Santiago&#xA;de Compostela (Eddy Sotelo, Pharmaceutical Chemistry) and U. Barcelona (Gemma&#xA;Navarro, Biochemistry).\n"
