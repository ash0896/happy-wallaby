    title: Introduction
    content: "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins which are\ninvolved in signal transduction across cellular membranes and represent about\n3% of the human encoding genome. They display important role in cellular\ncommunication and are the largest family of membrane receptors. About 30-40% of marketed drugs target a GPCR. Moreover, most potential GPCR drug targets for several indications do not have a drug on the market \\[1, 2]. GPCR activation occurs by the binding of a ligand in the extracellular side, stabilizing the active conformation of the receptor, which leads to the cellular response through dimerization with the intracellular G protein (according to generally accepted GPCR activation). The ligand for a GPCR compete with the natural\nagonist at the orthosteric side and either mimic (agonist) or block (antagonist) the pharmacological effect. Structurally, GPCRs display characteristic and conserved features of 7 transmembrane helical bundle, which are connected by 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. Different sequence analysis showed that the largest differences of GPCR occurred in the ligand binding site (the extracellular part) \\[1].\n\n\_Ligand based drug design techniques such as quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and computational ligand based virtual screening, were used for assessing the chemistry of GPCRs due to the lack of structural\ninformation within the GPCR superfamily. In the last decades, due to advances\nin protein engineering and protein crystallography in association with X-ray\ncrystallography structures of diverse GPCRs were revealed motivating the Nobel\nprize in 2012. The mechanism and structures have of diverse GPCRs structures\nwere determined using the same approach and the structure for A2AAR\nGPCR was crystallized, this enabled to apply the structure-based drug design on\nGPCRs. Due to high homology between the receptor subtypes which have different\npathophysiological functions it leads to pharmacological problems (decrease in\nselectivity). To avoid this highly elaborated chemical scaffolds are generated\nwhich lead to chemical problem (complex heterocycles with poor\npharmacokinetics). Therefore, despite the large-scale pharmacological interest\nin GPCRs only A2AAR agonist regadenoson and A2AAR\nantagonist istradefylline have been marketed\\[2].\n\n# \_\n\nThe superfamily of GPCRs is divided in classes (A-F)\nas proposed by Atwood and Findlay\\[1]. Out of which the rhodopsin like (class A)\nare the best characterized receptors. Within these, adenosine receptors (ARs)\nare of particular interest as they play an important role in signal\ntransduction for the extracellular nucleotide adenosine. The ARs family is\nfurther divided into four subtypes namely A1, A2A, A2B\nand A3 which mediate the signaling of adenosine\\[2].\_ The A3AR is involved in\ninflammation, pain, and allergic asthma by inhibiting adenylate cyclase, which\ncauses the release of inflammatory and allergic mediators from mast cells.\nTherefore, antagonists of A3AR are of use in treatment of stroke,\nglaucoma, inflammation and in development of antiallergic, antihistaminic and\ncerebroprotective drugs. Potentially A3AR antagonists also have\napplications in cancer chemotherapy due to high level of expression in several\ncell lines \\[4]. The A3 signaling is target of ischemia, inflammation\nand cancer,\\[6] but the expression levels and roles on different cellular\ntissues are still unknown. Therefore there is a need of new pharmacological\ntools to investigate on the pathophysiological roles if this receptor. In\nparticular, in vivo imaging or detection of receptor dimer or higher order\noligomers.\n\nThe host lab has been involved in the discovery and\nelucidation of the molecular mechanism of Adenosine receptor antagonists for\nthe past decade. The work lately made use of the host lab automated workflow\nfor small molecule and protein mutations free energy calculations in Q (QligFEP\nand QresFEP), in particular for the structural mapping of Adenosine receptor\nmutations, binding mechanism of A2AAR receptor antagonist, structure\nbased design at the four GPCR subtypes. Among these, the studies on A3AR\nrevealed a new pyrimidine pharmacophore with several potent and selective A3AR\nantagonists\\[7].\n\nThe development of structurally simple, potent, and\nselective AR antagonists has been accomplished with integrated approach\ncombining succinct and efficient synthetic methodologies and rational\ncomputer-based drug design. Recently, structurally simple amidopyrimidine\nmonocyclic scaffolds with variations at three points of diversity with low\nmolecular weight, potent and selective were studied as A3AR\nantagonists\\[5]. The study based on exploring diverse heterocyclic libraries showed\nthat tri and bi cyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds, with the pyrimidine core.\nBased on previous studies, it was expected that structural redecoration of aryl\nfragments on the amidopyrimidine scaffolds would modify the selectivity\nprofile. The screening of libraries was done by incorporating identical aryl\ngroups at positions 4,6 and 2,6 as a proof of concept\\[6]. Highly potent and\nselective A3AR antagonists have been documented by the introduction\nof methoxyphenyl fragments into the 4-aminopyrimidne scaffold. The\npharmacophore design focus on the nitrogen atom that is considered to be\ninvolved in hydrogen bond interactions. The N1 and N3 in heterocycle are\nessential for binding with N250 together with the exocyclic nitrogen. The\nsecond nitrogen atom of the 4-amidopyrimide series increased the binding\naffinities in comparison with the 2-amidopyrimidine series. To understand the\nrole of the second nitrogen in the 4-amidopyrimidine series, studies were\nperformed by comparing the N1 with the pyridine series. This generated highly\npotent and selective A3AR antagonists\\[5]. However, bioisosteric\nreplacement in most cases resulted in a loss of potency.\n\nTherefore, there is a need of validate this binding\nmode through site-directed mutagenesis and assess the design of new\npharmacological tools in collaboration with the experimental groups in Santiago\nde Compostela (Eddy Sotelo, Pharmaceutical Chemistry) and U. Barcelona (Gemma\nNavarro, Biochemistry).\n"
